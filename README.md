# AngularTourOfHeroes
This is my second Angular project - following the tutorial from Angular.io 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.3.

## What I learned 
- Created the initial application structure using the Angular CLI.
- How Angular components display data.
- Double curly braces of interpolation.
- Used the CLI to create a second Component.
- Displayed the Component by adding it to the AppComponent shell.
- Applied the UppercasePipe to format the name.
- Used two-way data binding with the ngModel directive.
- Learned about the AppModule.
- Imported the FormsModule.
- Learned the importance of declaring components in the AppModule.
- Used *ngFor to display a list.
- Used *ngIf to conditionally include or exclude a block of HTML.
- Toggle a CSS style class with a class binding.
- Created separate, reusable Components.
- Used a property binding to give the parent control over the child.
- Used the @Input decorator to make the property available for binding by an external Component.
- Refactored data access to a class.
- Registered a Service as the provider at the root level so that it can be injected anywhere in the application.
- Used Angular Dependency Injection to inject it into a component.
- Gave the service get data method an asynchronous signature.
- Discovered Observable and the RxJS Observable library.
- Used RxJS of() to return an observable.
- Created a service for loosely-coupled communication between classes.
- Injected a service into another service. 
- Added the Angular router to navigate among different components.
- Turned the AppComponent into a navigation shell with <a> links and a <router-outlet>.
- Configured the router in an AppRoutingModule
- Defined routes, a redirect route, and a parameterized route.
- Used the routerLink directive in anchor elements.
- Used router link parameters to navigate to the detail view.
- Shared a service among multiple components.
- Added the necessary dependencies to use HTTP in the app.
- Refactored a service to load from a web API.
- Extended a service to support post(), put(), and delete() methods.
- Updated the components to allow adding, editing, and deleting of heroes.
- Configured an in-memory web API.
- Learned how to use observables.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
